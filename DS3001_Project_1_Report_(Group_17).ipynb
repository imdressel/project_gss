        "The data used was from the General Seocial Survey (GSS) which is a personal-interview survey of US adults from over five decades since 1972 to understand changes in opinions and perspectives over time. The survey focuses on topics ranging from human rights to marlality and mental health. Our specific question was to understand correlations between factors affecting work-life balance. Two variables were used to examine the work component were \"hrs1\" and \"conrinc\". The hrs1 variable asked that, if a participant was working full or part time, how many hours they worked the previous week in categories ranging from 0 to 59 hours. The conrinc variable examined the inflation-adjusted personal income from $0-999,999. To understand the life side of this balance three variables were utilized: marital, childs, and meovrwrk. Marital looked if the participants were currently married, widowed, divorced, separated, or had never been married. The childs variable evaluated how many children an individual had ever had, counting all that were born alive at any time. Finally, meovrwrk noted how much individuals agreed or disagreed with the statement that their family life often suffers because men concentrate too much on their work. The timeline we decided to look at was 2018 and 2022 to contrast possible differences in family dynamics before and after the pandemic.      "
